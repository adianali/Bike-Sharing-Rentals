## Getting Started
1. Begin by either downloading or cloning this project.
2. Launch your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory (for this guide, Google Colab will be used).
3. Create a new notebook.
4. Upload and choose the file with the .ipynb extension.
5. Establish a connection to the hosted runtime.
6. Finally, execute the code cells.

## Dashboard Initialization
1. Obtain this project by downloading it.
2. Use your terminal or command prompt to install Streamlit with the command `pip install streamlit`. Ensure other libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and streamlit are also installed if they are not already.
3. Important: Do not relocate the CSV file, as it serves as the data source. Keep it in the same folder as dashboard.py.
4. Open Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and execute the file by accessing the terminal and entering in dashboard folder `python -m streamlit run dashboard.py`.
